# Focal-Fortuna
Fortuna is a crowd-funding platform that utilizes a custom written algorithmic trading platform to make orders and analyze the Market changes. It will feature portfolio optimization that utilizes equitiy data from an API (i have yet to choose a viable free option) to ensure that the value of the portfolio increases in value.

## General Premise
I want a platform that users can donate to community goals, where they will collect and 'snowball' funds to eventually meet their goals. GoFundMe is a prime example of the similar platform i will 'mimic' except with a smarter more optimized method of handling funds.

## Branch Details
This branch is a testbench for using PHP as a login system, I'm aware of other systems and I want to see which one is the best.
