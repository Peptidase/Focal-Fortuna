<h1>What is Focal-Fortuna?</h1>
<p>Fortuna is a Mutual fund for community goals. We recieve donations and optimize an equities portfolio so the community can reach a preset goal. It utilizes algorithmic medium term trading and the <b>QuantConnect API</b> for the data and orders.</p>    
<hr>
<h1>Why is Focal-Fortuna here?</h1>
<p>I wanted to make an algorithmic trading platform that was original, something that could be seen as new alongside using previously old technology. This uses papers from <b>Quantpedia</b> to find an 'edge' against the market which we utilize for reaching the community goals.</p>
<hr>
<h1>How much does Focal-Fortuna Cost?</h1>
<p>Aside from donations, a small management fee of around 2% of any Capital made. This way we can keep our fee small and you will always get the valuation you deserve.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Can I put my own goal on Focal-Fortuna?</h1>
<p>Yes you can! This is a work in progress but sending me an email with confirmation of identity and your goal details will allow me to construct a profile based on your specifications. Hopefully we can reach your goal together throguh communal donations and charity work!</p>
